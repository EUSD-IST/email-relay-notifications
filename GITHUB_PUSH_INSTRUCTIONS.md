# GitHub Push Instructions

Your repository is ready to push to GitHub. Since authentication is required, please follow one of these methods:

## Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "email-relay-notifications"
4. Select the "repo" scope
5. Generate the token and copy it
6. Run this command (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):
   ```bash
   git push https://josh-stephens:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/josh-stephens/email-relay-notifications.git main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI
1. Install GitHub CLI if not already installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gh
   ```
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Create the repository and push:
   ```bash
   gh repo create email-relay-notifications --public --source=. --push
   ```

## Option 3: Manual Setup
1. Create a new repository at https://github.com/new
   - Name: email-relay-notifications
   - Make it public or private as desired
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
2. Follow the "push an existing repository" instructions shown
